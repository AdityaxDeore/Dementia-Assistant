# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Summary - Updated October 2025

## üîß **RESOLVED: Base Path and Branch Configuration Issues**

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The GitHub Pages deployment was failing due to multiple configuration mismatches:

1. **Base Path Mismatch:** Vite config had `/Clarity/` but repository is `Dementia-Assistant`
2. **Branch Mismatch:** Workflow triggered on `main` but repository uses `master`
3. **Asset Path Issues:** Built files had incorrect repository base paths
4. **SPA Routing Problems:** 404.html had wrong redirect configuration

### **Issues Fixed**
‚úÖ **Vite Configuration:** Updated base path to `/Dementia-Assistant/`
‚úÖ **GitHub Workflow:** Changed trigger branch from `main` to `master`
‚úÖ **Asset Paths:** All JavaScript/CSS now load with correct repository paths
‚úÖ **SPA Routing:** Updated 404.html for proper client-side routing
‚úÖ **Build Process:** Verified all assets generate with correct base paths

### **Deployment Status**
üéØ **Changes Committed & Pushed:** `git push origin master` completed successfully
üîÑ **GitHub Actions:** Workflow should trigger automatically within 1-2 minutes
‚è±Ô∏è **Expected Live Time:** 5-10 minutes from workflow completion
üåê **Live URL:** https://AdityaxDeore.github.io/Dementia-Assistant/

### **Verification Steps**
1. Check GitHub repository ‚Üí Actions tab for workflow status
2. Wait for green checkmark indicating successful deployment
3. Visit the live URL and test all React components
4. Verify Phase 1 features are accessible (Voice Analysis, Memory Diary, SOS)
3. Missing proper SPA routing configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Modified [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to:
- Build only the client application (not the server)
- Copy the 404.html file to the build directory for SPA routing
- Ensure proper artifact upload to GitHub Pages

### 2. Fixed Vite Configuration
Updated [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts) to:
- Set `base: "/"` for proper GitHub Pages routing

### 3. Enhanced 404.html for SPA Routing
Updated [client/404.html](client/404.html) to:
- Include proper viewport meta tag
- Implement better client-side routing for SPAs

### 4. Added Build Scripts
Enhanced [package.json](package.json) with:
- `build:client` script for building only the client
- `build:test` script for testing the build process
- `deploy` script for manual deployment using gh-pages

### 5. Added Dependencies
Installed `gh-pages` package for manual deployment option

### 6. Created Documentation
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) - Detailed deployment guide
- Updated [README.md](README.md) with deployment information
- This summary file

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to deploy from GitHub Actions:
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: GitHub Actions
2. Push changes to the `main` branch
3. Workflow will automatically build and deploy

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Run the build test:
   ```bash
   npm run build:test
   ```
2. If successful, deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy from Branch
1. Build the client:
   ```bash
   npm run build:client
   ```
2. Deploy using subtree push:
   ```bash
   git add dist/public -f
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git subtree push --prefix dist/public origin gh-pages
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the README.md file:
1. Check that GitHub Pages source is set correctly
2. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow ran successfully
3. Ensure the build artifacts are in the correct directory
4. Check browser cache and hard refresh
